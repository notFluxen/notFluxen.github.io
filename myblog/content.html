                <h2 class=header4 id="point1">General Concepts</p>
                <p class=texts3>My game will be a 2D topdown-survival-shooter titled "Inqubit".<br> It is a roguelite game where you have to survive waves of various mythological creature </p>
                
                <h2 class=header4 id="point2">Mechanics</p>
                <p class=texts3>Now, there are various mechanics I am planning to implement. But 
                    we are just gonna talk about the core ones.<br> Firstly, the roguelite system, since it's roguelite, there will be some progress preserved during each run. Examples of this includes blueprints and powers.
                Secondly, the time mechanics, in this game you can tinker with time using tools and powers to achieve your goal. Like rewinding an enemy to buy time as an example.
            Other than that, each run will have different procedurally-generated levels, so more replayability. </p>

            <h2 class=header4 id="point3">Plot, Characters, etc.</p>
            <p class=texts3>The game is set in an era of chaotic timelines, causing a rift in time to appear and summon various mythological beings from within. Our protagonist, Amara, is a member of the Time Keepers, embark on a journey to fix the time lines. 
                There will be multiple endings for the game depending on your choices. This game will be a side project for me and hopefully done by the time I entered 10th grade. Stay tune for more! </p>
